Depth-first search

  The search tree is deepended as much as possible before going to the next
  sibling. Always recursively traverse the current node's left subtree. But the
  order of the Nodes will depende on the type of the method

  Pre-order 
    NLR (Node-Left-Right)
    1. Visit the current node
    2. Recursively traverse the current node's left subtree
    3. Recursively traverse the current node's right subtree
  
  In-order
    LNR (Left-Node-Right)
  
  Post-Order
    LRN (Left-Right-Node)

We also reve the Rever pre-order, Reverse post-order and Reverse in-order

In summary:

  Pre-order: NLR
  In-order: LNR
  Post-order LRN
  Reverse pre-order NRL
  Reverse in-order RNL
  Reverse post-order: RLN
