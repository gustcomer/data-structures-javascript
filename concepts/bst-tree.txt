Introduction:

  Binary Search Trees (BST) are Trees with some extra rules applied. It only
  allows you to store nodes with lesses values on the left-hand side and nodes
  with greater values on the right-hand side.

Definitions:

Left and Right Subtree: the children of each node can be divided in 2 subtrees
  aka: Child subtree
Left and Right Child: each node can have at most 2 children.
Key: is the data hold by each node
  aka: Data, Value

Invariants:

  - any node can have at most two children
  - is allowed to have zero nodes
  - the data in the right Node is greater than the data in the left node
  - each node is greater than its left child and smaller than its right child


Notes:

  - Take a look at the tree definitions. They are all valid.
  - Each level of the BST can have a log 2 number of Nodes.
  - no node has degree greater than 2
  - skewed trees
  - complete binary trees
